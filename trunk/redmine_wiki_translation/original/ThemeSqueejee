h2. Features

The SqueejeeÂ© theme is an updated, packaged release of Wynn Netherland's work for "Squeejee's":http://www.squeejee.com internal Redmine instance. It initially was a heavily modified derivation of the [[ThemeAlternate|alternate theme]] which required Redmine core hacks but is made stand-alone and working without core hacks (by using the core's support for project-menu item styling (r2059)) for this release.

It's looks can be best described as a dark theme with gradient backgrounds, dark-gray and bold links, but all with a "shiny" and "friendly" touch. It reintroduces the project-menu item-icons with the extension that styling of third-party plugins (including selected icons) is supported too.
Also the overflow to a second line of the project-menu, when using a lot of plugins with menu-items, is handled without disturbing the surrounding layout and elements.

The colour-scheme basically consists of three basic colours: black, grey and white.

It includes:
* issue-colouring in the issuelist, based on default priority-enumerations for issues
* more sophistically styled "tabs", "tables", etc.
* (project-menu item styling) support for (lots of) third-party plugins
