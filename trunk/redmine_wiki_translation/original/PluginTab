h2. Description

The Tab plugin is a Redmine plugin which provides the ability to create a new Redmine tab, to embed content from an iframe, on a per-project base. This is done by storing the iframe-snippet in a project custom field.
It also provides the ability to add a new, system-wide top menu tab. The iframe-source for that tab can be configured in the plugin settings.

Besides these two features it also allows you to modify the actual tab and link names, without changing the source of the plugin, in the plugin settings.

This plugin is compatible with both Redmine 0.8.x and Redmine trunk.

h2. Setup

h3. Project-specific tabs

This plugin creates a project-menu tab in which you can embed an iframe. You can globally configure the name of the tab in the Plugins -> Tab Plugin configuration options, under "Project Specific -> Tab Name" (default is "Tab Name").
The iframe-sources for the individual projects can be configured on a per-project base using the value of a pre-configured project custom field (configured under "Project Specific -> Tab Text" (default is "none").

# You need to go to 'Admin -> Custom fields -> Project' and create a field of the type 'Long text' to hold the iframe link.
# Select the project custom field you've created in the plugin configuration, by going to Plugins -> Tab Plugin configuration options, under "Project Specific -> Tab Text".
# Inside your project you will need to add your iframe-link as the value of the project custom field you've selected. For example to embed Google: <pre><iframe src="http://www.google.com/" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></pre>
# Then use the project's Modules tab to enable the Tab module for the project; go to the preferred Redmine project -> "Project settings":
** On the "Modules" tab: enable the plugin-module by checking "Tab".

After that, the new project menu item will show up in the project menu.

h3. System-wide tab (link)

The plugin also provides the ability to add a new, system-wide top-menu tab (link). You can globally configure the name of the tab in the Plugins -> Tab Plugin configuration options, under "System wide -> Tab Name" (default is "System Tab Name").
The iframe-source for the new top menu link can be globally configured using the value of the plugin setting "System wide -> Tab Text" (default is "none").
