In the news area you can publish news items about the project or any subject you like.

You can give the news item a title, a summary and the detailed description. The summary will be displayed in the *_Latest news_* area of the [[RedmineProjectOverview|Overview]] page whereas the description will be displayed if you click on the title (in this case _Release 0.8.0 release candidate_) of the news item.

If you have the permission to create news items than you can edit an existing news entry.
