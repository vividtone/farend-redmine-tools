h2. Description

The Charts plugin integrates some project-based, time-tracking charts. Most of the charts provided by this plugin depend on issues which have a certain amount of estimated time set and logged spent-time (on plugins as well as on the project itself).

h3. Chart types

In total four kinds of charts are provided by the plugin:
# @Burndown@
** Timeline with estimated, logged and remaining hours.
# @Logged hours ratio@
** Number of hours which were logged, proportional to total total, grouped and filtered by users, issues, activities, categories, version, priorities or trackers.
# @Logged hours timeline@
** Timeline with logged hours, grouped and filtered by users, issues, activities, categories, version, priorities and trackers.
# @Logged hours deviations@
** Ratio of logged and remaining hours to estimated hours for each estimated issue.
