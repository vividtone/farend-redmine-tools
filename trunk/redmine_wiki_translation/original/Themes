h1. Themes

As of version @0.6.0@ (r818), Redmine provides basic support for themes. Redmine themes can override stylesheets only (like @application.css@).

h2. Installing a theme

1. First, copy the theme-directory into @../public/themes/@. This would result in a directory-path to @application.css@ like: <pre>
../public/themes/<themename>/stylesheets/application.css</pre>

2. You now may need to restart Redmine so that it shows the newly installed theme in the list of available themes.

2. Go to "Administration -> Settings" and select your newly created theme in the "Theme" drop-down list. Save your settings.

Redmine should now be displayed using the selected theme.

h2. Theme list

A list of available Redmine themes can be found at the [[Theme List|Redmine theme list]].

h2. Creating custom themes

There is a howto ([[HowTo create a custom Redmine theme]]) which explains how to create a custom Redmine theme.
