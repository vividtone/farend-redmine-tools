h1. Schedules Plugin

This is a plugin for Redmine to manage users and assigned projects over time. The primary problems that it addresses (and aims to address) are questions like the following:

* If I'm assigned to many projects, which ones should I work on today?
* How many developer hours are committed to my project this Tuesday?
* I need another developer for my project tomorrow. Who's available?
* Are my project's developers logging their time appropriately?
