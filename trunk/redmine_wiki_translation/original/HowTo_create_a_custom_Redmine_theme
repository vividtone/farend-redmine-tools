h1. HowTo create a custom Redmine theme

As of r818, Redmine offers basic support for themes.
Themes can override stylesheets only (application.css).

h2. Creating a new theme

Create a directory in @public/themes@. The directory name will be used as the theme name.

Example:

  public/themes/my_theme

Create your custom @application.css@ and save it in a subdirectory named @stylesheets@:

  public/themes/my_theme/stylesheets/application.css

Here is an example of a custom stylesheet that only override a few settings:

<pre><code>/* load the default Redmine stylesheet */
@import url(../../../stylesheets/application.css);

/* add a logo in the header */
#header {
    background: #507AAA url(../images/logo.png) no-repeat 2px;
    padding-left: 86px;
}

/* move the project menu to the right */
#main-menu { 
    left: auto;
    right: 0px;
}
</code></pre>

This example assume you have an image located at @my_theme/images/logo.png@.

You can download this sample theme as a starting point for your own theme. Extract it in the @public/themes@ directory.

h2. Applying the theme

Go to "Administration -> Settings" and select your newly created theme in the "Theme" drop-down list. Save your settings.
Redmine should now be displayed using your custom theme.

_Note that if you install a new theme, you may need to restart the application so that it shows up in the list of available themes._
