h2. Repositories

h3. Autofetch commits

If this option is activated, the application automatically retrieves the new revisions when a user consults the repository.

_Default: Yes_

You can disable this option and automate the call to Repository#fetch_changesets using cron to regularly retrieve the revisions for all of the repositories in the background.
Example:
<pre>ruby script/runner "Repository.fetch_changesets" -e production</pre>

You can also call this task from your repository in a post-commit or post-receive hook, so that changesets are fetched after each commit.
Here is a tutorial for doing so with git: http://finalcog.com/remine-git-post-receive

h3. Enable WS for repository management

This option should be activated only if you installed the script for automatic SVN repository creation. _Default: No_

h3. Enabled SCM

Here you can (de)select the SCM-systems Redmine should "provide" to the individual projects. This setting is usefull if you only support several SCM-systems (e.g. only Git or only SVN).

h3. Repositories encodings

This option lets you specify prefered encodings for repository files (multiple values allowed, comma separated). These encodings are used to convert files content and diff to UTF-8 so that they're properly displayed in the browser.
When entering multiple encodings, the first valid encoding regarding the file content is used.

For French users, this option can be for example set to:

  UTF-8, ISO 8859-15, CP1252

For Japanese users:

  ISO-2022-JP, EUC-JP, UTF-8, SHIF_JIS, WINDOWS-31J

h3. Maximum number of revisions displayed on file log

This setting will be added in Redmine version#6. It provides a way to limit the amount of revisions which are retrieved from the SCM for a certain, browsed path.

h3. Referencing issues in commit messages

When fetched from the repositories, commit messages are scanned for referenced or fixed issue IDs.
These options lets you define keywords that can be used in commit message to reference or fix issues automatically, and the status to apply to fixed issues.

Default keywords are:

* for referencing issues: refs, references, IssueID
* for fixing issues: fixes, closes

There's no default status defined for fixed issue. You'll have to specify it if you want to enable auto closure of issues.
If you want to reference issues without using keywords, enter a single star: * in the *Referencing keywords* setting. In this case, any issue ID found in the message will be linked to the changeset.

Example of a working commit message using default keywords:

  This commit refs #1, #2 and fixes #3

This message would reference issues 1 and 2 and automatically fix issue 3.
After a keyword issue IDs can be separated with a space, a comma or &.
