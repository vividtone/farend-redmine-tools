h1. PMO

Project Management Offices need to provision and track workloads between competing projects.  Redmine is a great project collaboration tool for software teams.  

A series of plugins are under development in order to ease the use of Redmine as a PMO tool :
* "Workload":http://github.com/chris2fr/redmine_workload (weekly timesheet and future assignments per developper with summary information)
* "Taskjuggler":http://github.com/chris2fr/redmine_taskjuggler (for scheduling future tasks leveredged by a first-class scheduling program)

Redmine 0.9 also takes better into account task dependencies.  The Taskjuggler round-trip extension and plugin is user for controling developper overload.  Workload eases planning of future tasks in man-days.

These plugins are currently under beta development and participation is very much welcome !
