h1. Classic theme

This is the classic Redmine theme which is inspired by the Redmine v0.5.1 design.

h2. Author

Same as the author of Redmine itself: Jean-Philippe Lang.

h2. Description

This is one of the two additional themes which is distributed as part of the Redmine core. The classic theme is a reincarnation of the old (_classic_) Redmine v0.5.1 design which is reworked to a individual theme after the switch to the v0.6.0 [[ThemeDefault|default theme]].

The classic theme distincts itself by being a more "thicker" styled theme. It clearly distincts different cells and fields by using plain white borders. The links are visually clearly distinctable also. The used colours and icons are pretty coloured though can make the views a bit busy.
If you are classic-addict you should probably check this them if it suits your demands.
