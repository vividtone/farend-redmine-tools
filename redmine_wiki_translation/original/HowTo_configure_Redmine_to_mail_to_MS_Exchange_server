h1. HowTo configure Redmine to mail to MS Exchange server

MS Exchange works the same way that others SMTP server: just edit your *config/environment.rb* file with your favorite text editor. Around the lines 45, you'll see this:

  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
                :address => "127.0.0.1",
                :port => 25,
                :domain => "somenet.foo",
                :authentication => :login,
                :user_name => "redmine",
                :password => "redmine",
  }

Most often, MS Exchange will not require authentication informations, so you'll just have to comment out :domain, :authentication, :user_name and :password lines.

  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
                :address => "*my_ms_exchange_adress*",
                :port => *25*,
              #  :domain => "somenet.foo",
              #  :authentication => :login,
              #  :user_name => "redmine",
              #  :password => "redmine",
   }

Of course, you have to put in front of :address your MS Exchange IP (or DNS name, if Redmine host has a DNS access) and eventually to customize your :port number. For these informations, ask to your administrator.
