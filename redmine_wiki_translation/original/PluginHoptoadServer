h1. HoptoadServer Plugin

This plugin transforms your Redmine into a hub for Rails exception handling, similar to "Hoptoad":http://hoptoadapp.com/welcome or "Exceptional":http://getexceptional.com/ . An issue will be created or updated for every exception which is thrown in your live applications. This plugin acts as a server for the HoptoadNotifier which was written by the guys at Hoptoad.


h2. Features

* Creates or updates an issue whenever an exception is thrown in your Rails application
* Includes backtrace, user session, request and environment
* Includes a link to the source file and line to see where the exception happened
* Allows backtrace filtering
* Adds a custom field to issues to count occurences of this exception (for better prioritizing)
* Adds a custom field to issues to sort/filter/group exceptions by (ruby) error class
