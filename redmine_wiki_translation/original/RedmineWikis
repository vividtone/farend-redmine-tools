h1. Wikis

h2. Creating a new wiki page

As in every wiki, just add a link to a page by putting this kind:

<pre>![[MyNewWikiPage]]</pre>

Then save, and click on that link: you have created a new wiki page with "MyNewWikiPage" as name. Congratulations.

h2. Creating sub-pages (parent/child relationships)

(From the [[FAQ]]).

Looking at http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Page_index/special it is possible to make use of some sort of sub-paging like:
> * Guide
> ** RedmineAccounts
> ** RedmineCustomFields
> ** RedmineInstall
> ** RedmineIssueList
> ** RedmineIssues
This can be accomplished by assigning a parent page to a to-be child-page. This assignment can be done via the @rename@ dialog.
Thus, create both the child- and parent-pages and then open the to-be child-page and click "rename", then enter the name of the parent page.
