h1. Enumerations

Enumerations are global (cross-project) values for several parts of the Redmine system:
* Activities (time tracking)
* Document categories
* Issue priorities

These items can be added, modified and deleted freely. They all have one configurable setting which is if the current enumeration should be the default value.
If the default-value checkbox is ticked, the selected enumeration will be the default value for the specific field(s). If no enumeration has been set to the default-value for the specific enumeration-category (activities, document categories or issue priorities) no enumeration will be pre-selected for the specific field(s).
