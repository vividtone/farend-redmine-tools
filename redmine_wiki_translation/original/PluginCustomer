h1. Customer Plugin

This is a plugin for Redmine that can be used to track basic customer information for each project.  It was created so I could track which project belonged to which customer.

h2. Features

For this first release, I implemented the most basic features.

* Store Customer data
* Associate a Customer for each project
* Permissions to control user access to data
