h3. Redmine links

Redmine allows hyperlinking between issues, changesets and wiki pages from anywhere wiki formatting is used.

* Link to an issue: *!#124* (displays #124, link is striked-through if the issue is closed)
* Link to a changeset: *!r758* (displays r758)
* Link to a changeset with a non-numeric hash: *commit:c6f4d0fd* (displays c6f4d0fd).  Added in r1236.

Wiki links:

* *&#91;&#91;Guide&#93;&#93;* displays a link to the page named 'Guide': [[Guide]]
* *&#91;&#91;Guide|User manual&#93;&#93;* displays a link to the same page but with a different text: [[Guide|User manual]]
* *&#91;&#91;Guide#User-guide|User guide&#93;&#93;* displays a link to the header on the same page with a different text: [[Guide#User-guide|User guide]]

You can also link to pages of an other project wiki:

* *&#91;&#91;sandbox:some page&#93;&#93;* displays a link to the page named 'Some page' of the Sandbox wiki
* *&#91;&#91;sandbox:&#93;&#93;* displays a link to the Sandbox wiki main page

Wiki links are displayed in red if the page doesn't exist yet, eg: [[Nonexistent page]].

Links to others resources (0.7):

* Documents:

  * *!document#17* (link to document with id 17)
  * *!document:Greetings* (link to the document with title "Greetings")
  * *!document:"Some document"* (double quotes can be used when document title contains spaces)

* Versions:

  * *!version#3* (link to version with id 3)
  * *!version:1.0.0* (link to version named "1.0.0")
  * *!version:"1.0 beta 2"*

* Attachments:
  
  * *!attachment:file.zip* (link to the attachment of the current object named file.zip)
  * For now, attachments of the current object can be referenced only (if you're on an issue, it's possible to reference attachments of this issue only)

* Repository files

  * *!source:some/file*          -- Link to the file located at /some/file in the project's repository
  * *!source:some/file@52*       -- Link to the file's revision 52
  * *!source:some/file#L120*     -- Link to line 120 of the file
  * *!source:some/file@52#L120*  -- Link to line 120 of the file's revision 52
  * *!export:some/file*          -- Force the download of the file

Escaping (0.7):

* You can prevent Redmine links from being parsed by preceding them with an exclamation mark: !

h3. External links

HTTP URLs and email addresses are automatically turned into clickable links: 

<pre>
http://www.redmine.org, someone@foo.bar
</pre>

displays: http://www.redmine.org, someone@foo.bar

If you want to display a specific text instead of the URL, you can use the standard textile syntax:

<pre>
"Redmine web site":http://www.redmine.org
</pre>

displays: "Redmine web site":http://www.redmine.org

h2. Text formatting

For things such as headlines, bold, tables, lists, Redmine supports Textile syntax.  See http://hobix.com/textile/ for information on using any of these features.  A few samples are included below, but the engine is capable of much more of that.

h3. Font style

<pre><code>* *bold*
* _italic_
* *_bold italic_*
* +underline+
* -strike-through-
</code></pre>

Display:

 * *bold*
 * _italic_
 * *_bold italic_*
 * +underline+
 * -strike-through-

h3. Inline images

* *&#33;image_url&#33;* displays an image located at image_url (textile syntax)
* *&#33;>image_url&#33;* right floating image
* *&#33;{width:300px}image_url&#33;* sets the width of the image

If you have an image attached to your wiki page, it can be displayed inline using its filename: *&#33;attached_image.png&#33;*

h3. Headings

<pre><code>h1. Heading
h2. Subheading
h3. Subheading
</code></pre>

h3. Paragraphs

<pre><code>p>. right aligned
p=. centered
</code></pre>

p=. This is centered paragraph.

h3. Blockquotes

Start the paragraph with *bq.*

<pre><code>bq. Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.
To go live, all you need to add is a database and a web server.
</code></pre>

Display:

h3. Tables

<pre>
|_.UserID|_.Name|_.Group|
|\3=.IT|
|1|Artur Pirozhkov|/2.Users|
|2|Vasya Rogov|
|3|John Smith|Admin|
</pre>

Display:

|_.UserID|_.Name|_.Group|
|\3=.IT|
|1|Artur Pirozhkov|/2.Users|
|2|Vasya Rogov|
|3|John Smith|Admin|

h3. Table of content

<pre><code>{{toc}} => left aligned toc
{{>toc}} => right aligned toc
</code></pre>

h2. Macros

Redmine has the following builtin macros:

{{macro_list}}


h2. Code highlighting

Code highlightment relies on "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/, a fast syntax highlighting library written completely in Ruby. It currently supports c, html, javascript, rhtml, ruby, scheme, xml languages.

You can highlight code in your wiki page using this syntax:

<pre><code><pre><code class="ruby">
  Place you code here.
</code></pre>
</pre></code>

Example:

<pre><code class="ruby">
# The Greeter class
class Greeter
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name.capitalize
  end
 
  def salute
    puts "Hello #{@name}!"
  end
end
</pre></code>
