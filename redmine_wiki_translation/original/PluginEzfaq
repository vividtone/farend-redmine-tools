h2. Note

Since the plugin applies a patch to redmine core, it can only run properly under
production environment. When runs under development envrionment, the faq with attachments
will fail to show.

Redmine currently doesn't support plugin to extend its search scope, so you have to
modify redmine's search controller to search FAQ.
(Edit ln51 in search_controller.rb, add faqs to the @object_types)
