h2. Author

Same as the author of Redmine itself: Jean-Philippe Lang.

h2. Description

This is one of the two additional themes which is distributed as part of the Redmine core. It is a derivative of an older revision of the default Redmine theme, which was specifically modified to include issuelist-colouring based on issue's priority, which is included with the Redmine core as an optional, _alternative_ theme.

It's looks can be best described as a light-version of the [[ThemeDefault|default theme]] with some specific enhancements over the default theme. The colouring is mainly designed around three basic colours: blue, dark-blue and white/grey.

It does not provides the more sophistically styled "tabs", "tables", etc. from the [[ThemeDefault|default theme]].
