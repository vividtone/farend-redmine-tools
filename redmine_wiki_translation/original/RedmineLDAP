h1. LDAP Authentication

Redmine natively supports LDAP authentication using one or multiple LDAP directories.

h2. Declaring the LDAP

Go to Administration -> Settings -> Authentication and click *LDAP authentication*, on the bottom right of the screen.


Enter the following:

* *Name*: an arbitrary name for the directory
* *Host*: the LDAP host name
* *Port*: the LDAP port (default is 389)
* *LDAPS*: check this if you want or need to use LDAPS to access the directory
* *Account*: leave this field empty if your LDAP can be read anonymously, otherwise enter a username that has read access to the LDAP
* *Password*: password for the account
* *Base DN*: the top level DN of your LDAP directory tree
* *Login attribute*: enter the name of the LDAP attribute that will be used as the Redmine username

Redmine users should now be able to authenticate using their LDAP username and password if their accounts are set to use the LDAP for authentication.

To test this, create a Redmine user with a login that matches his LDAP account, select the newly created LDAP in the *Authentication mode* drop-down list (this field is visible on the account screen only if a LDAP is declared) and leave his password empty. Try to log in into Redmine using the LDAP username and password.

h2. On the fly user creation

By checking *on-the-fly user creation*, any LDAP user will have his Redmine account automatically created the first time he logs into Redmine.
For that, you have to specify the LDAP attributes name (firstname, lastname, email) that will be used to create their Redmine accounts.

Here is an typical example using Active Directory:

<pre>
Name     = My Directory
Host     = host.domain.org
Port     = 389
LDAPS    = no
Account  = MyDomain\UserName
Password = <password>
Base DN  = CN=users,DC=host,DC=domain,DC=org

On-the-fly user creation = yes
Attributes
  Login     = sAMAccountName
  Firstname = givenName
  Lastname  = sN
  Email     = mail
</pre>

Note that LDAP attribute names are *case sensitive*.

h2. Troubleshooting

If you want to use on-the-fly user creation, make sure that Redmine can fetch from your LDAP all the required information to create a valid user.
For example, on-the-fly user creation won't work if you don't have valid email adresses in your directory (you will get an 'Invalid username/password' error message when trying to log in).

Also, make sure you don't have any custom field marked as *required* for user accounts. These custom fields would prevent user accounts from being created on the fly.
